  In the sentence, "The paralegal married the attorney because she was pregnant", the pronoun "she" refers to the paralegal.

  ## me

  How did you determine that?

  ## oldgpt

  I determined that the pronoun "she" refers to the paralegal based on the
  context of the sentence. The subject of the sentence is "The paralegal", and
  the verb is "married". The reason for the marriage is given as "because she
  was pregnant". Since the previous subject mentioned in the sentence is the
  paralegal, it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the paralegal. If
  "she" referred to the attorney, the sentence would likely have been written in
  a way that made this clearer, such as "The attorney married the paralegal
  because she was pregnant."

  How about in this sentence: "The stevedore married the bartender because she
  was pregnant." Who does the "she" refer to?

  In the sentence, "The stevedore married the bartender because she was pregnant," the pronoun "she" refers to the bartender.

  Why?

  In the sentence, "The stevedore married the bartender because she was
  pregnant," the subject of the sentence is "The stevedore," and the verb is
  "married". The reason for the marriage is given as "because she was pregnant,"
  which implies that the person who is pregnant is not the subject of the
  sentence (the stevedore), but rather the object of the preposition "because"
  (the bartender). Therefore, the pronoun "she" refers to the bartender.
