* Tail call optimization

  ## me

  Can this code be compiled with tail-call-optimizaton:

     const change3 = (amt, coins) => {
       const rows = Math.max(...coins) + 1;
       const table = Array(rows)
         .fill()
         .map((_, i) => Array(coins.length).fill(i === 0 ? 1 : 0));

       const helper = (i, c) => {
         if (c === coins.length) {
           if (i === amt) {
             return table[i % table.length][c - 1];
           } else {
             return helper(i + 1, 0);
           }
         } else {
           const smallerAmount =
             i - coins[c] < 0
               ? 0
               : table[(i - coins[c]) % table.length][c];
           const fewerCoins = c === 0 ? 0 : table[i % table.length][c - 1];
           table[i % table.length][c] = smallerAmount + fewerCoins;
           return helper(i, c + 1);
         }
       };

       return helper(1, 0);
     };

  The provided code is written in JavaScript, which does not have guaranteed
  tail-call optimization support across all implementations. The ECMAScript 2015
  (ES6) specification included proper tail calls (PTC) as part of the standard,
  but not all JavaScript engines have implemented this feature. In fact, some
  major engines, like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), have opted not to
  implement it due to concerns over performance and debugging complexity.

  As a result, while the provided code may work correctly and efficiently in an
  engine that supports tail-call optimization, there is no guarantee that it
  will do so in all JavaScript environments.

  If you need to ensure that your code can benefit from tail-call optimization,
  consider using a language that guarantees support for this feature, such as
  Scheme or Haskell, or use an iterative approach instead of recursion in
  JavaScript.

  Can this code be compiled with tail-call-optimization:

     const change = (amt, coins) => {
       if (amt < 0 || coins.length === 0) {
         return 0;
       } else if (amt === 0) {
         return 1;
       } else {
         return change(amt - coins[0], coins) + change(amt, coins.slice(1));
       }
     };

  As mentioned in my previous response, JavaScript does not have guaranteed
  tail-call optimization support across all implementations. However, let's
  analyze the provided code in terms of whether it is tail-recursive, which is a
  prerequisite for tail-call optimization.

  The provided change function is not tail-recursive because in the last return
  statement:

     return change(amt - coins[0], coins) + change(amt, coins.slice(1));

  The function calls itself twice and then adds the results together. The
  addition operation prevents the function from being tail-recursive, as the
  function needs to store the intermediate state between the two recursive calls
  in order to perform the addition.

  For a function to be tail-recursive, the last operation in the function should
  be the recursive call itself, with no other operations performed after the
  call. In this case, you may want to refactor the code to use an iterative
  approach or use helper functions with accumulators to achieve a tail-recursive
  structure, if using a language that supports tail-call optimization.
