* Math is hard

One way to see the difference between plausible output—what ChatGPT is great
at—and factual output—which it is not—is to ask it to do some math. Computers
are great at math, right? Let’s start simple.

  ## me

  What's 2 + 2?

  ##.

  ## gpt

  2 + 2 equals 4.

  ##.

So far, so good. But we could do that ourselves. Let’s get it to actually do
some work for us:

  ## me

  Can you give me a list of ten random numbers with a mean of 20?

  ##.

  ## gpt

  Sure, here's a list of ten random numbers that have a mean of 20:

  17, 25, 22, 18, 19, 21, 15, 23, 20, 24

  To verify the mean:

  (17 + 25 + 22 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 15 + 23 + 20 + 24) / 10 = 200 / 10 = 20

  ##.

Wait a sec. 17 + 25 + 22 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 15 + 23 + 20 + 24 = 204, not 200. So
the mean is 204 / 10 = 20.4, not 20. Well, we all make mistakes. Let’s give it
another chance.

  ## me

  You're off by 0.4. Can you fix it?

  ##.

  ## gpt

  Apologies for that. Here's a corrected list of ten random numbers with a mean of 20:

  16, 26, 22, 18, 19, 21, 15, 23, 20, 24

  To verify the mean:

  (16 + 26 + 22 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 15 + 23 + 20 + 24) / 10 = 204 / 10 = 20

  ##.

So, this time it got the sum right but 204 / 10 is definitely not 20.

  ## me

  That's still wrong. I want a mean of exactly 20, not 20.4.

  ##.

  ## gpt

  I apologize for the mistake. Here's a corrected list of ten random numbers with a mean of exactly 20:

  17, 25, 22, 18, 19, 21, 16, 23, 20, 24

  To verify the mean:

  (17 + 25 + 22 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 16 + 23 + 20 + 24) / 10 = 200 / 10 = 20

  ##.

That’s a slighly different list of numbers than the first one. This time the
actual sum is 205, not 200. So let’s see if we can help it check it’s work:

  ## me

  What is the sum of these numbers: (17 + 25 + 22 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 16 + 23 + 20 + 24)

  ##.

  ## gpt

  The sum of these numbers is:

  (17 + 25 + 22 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 16 + 23 + 20 + 24) = 205

  ##.

Right! Now let’s see if it can see it’s mistake.

  ## me

  Can you recalculate the mean with that fact?

  ##.

  ## gpt

  I apologize for the confusion earlier. Given the corrected sum of 205, let's recalculate the mean:

  Mean = (Sum of numbers) / (Number of elements)
  Mean = 205 / 10 = 20.5

  So, the mean of these numbers is 20.5, not 20. I apologize for the errors in my previous responses.

  ##.

Also right!

  ## me

  Now can you make a list that actually has a mean of 20?

  ##.

  ## gpt

  My apologies for the confusion earlier. Here's a corrected list of ten numbers with a mean of exactly 20:

  17, 25, 21, 18, 19, 22, 16, 23, 20, 24

  To verify the mean:

  (17 + 25 + 21 + 18 + 19 + 22 + 16 + 23 + 20 + 24) / 10 = 205 / 10 = 20

  ##.

The chat interface may lure us into wondering if maybe it’s “trying to solve a
different problem” or making some kind of mistake that we’ve seen humans make.
However that is just not what’s going on. ChatGPT is just doing what it always
does which is generating plausible text; it is not trying to get the answer
right or wrong. If it seems more plausible to say that a bunch of numbers sum to
200 when they don’t it will. When it seems more plausible to say that 204 / 10 =
20, it’ll do that. In its current form it is not able to incorporate new
information, even information that it provides itself like the correct sum of a
list of numbers.
