* The Story of Mac

Let’s ask GPT-4 about a thing from my book \i{[Practical Common Lisp]}:

  ## me

  Do you know the Story of Mac about the invention of Lisp macros?

  ##.

  The story you are referring to is known as "The Story of Mel," not "The Story of
  Mac." It is a popular anecdote in computer programming folklore about a
  programmer named Mel Kaye. However, the story is not related to the invention of
  Lisp macros. Instead, it tells the tale of a real programmer, Mel Kaye, who
  worked at the Royal McBee Computer Corporation in the late 1950s and early
  1960s. Mel was known for his exceptional skills in programming early computers,
  such as the LGP-30 and RPC-4000, using assembly language and writing highly
  optimized code.

  Lisp macros, on the other hand, were introduced as part of the Lisp programming
  language, which was developed by John McCarthy. Macros are a powerful feature of
  Lisp that allows code to generate and manipulate other code at runtime, enabling
  metaprogramming and the creation of domain-specific languages.

  While "The Story of Mel" is an entertaining and often-cited piece of programming
  folklore, it does not discuss the invention of Lisp macros or their development.

  I'm talking about "The Story of Mac: A Just-So Story" from Practical Common Lisp.

  I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. "The Story of Mac: A
  Just-So Story" is indeed a story from the book "Practical Common Lisp" by Peter
  Seibel. The story serves as an allegorical explanation of how Lisp macros were
  invented and why they are useful.

  In the story, there is a tribe of programmers who speak Lisp, and among them is
  a wise programmer named Mac. The tribe faces a problem where they need to
  repeatedly perform similar but slightly different tasks. Instead of writing
  separate functions for each task, Mac realizes that he can write a single
  function that generates the required code for each task. He calls this new
  function a "macro."

  The other tribe members initially resist the idea of macros, but eventually,
  they come to appreciate the power of macros in Lisp, allowing them to write more
  concise, expressive, and maintainable code.

  While this story is a fictional and playful explanation, it effectively conveys
  the concept of Lisp macros and their importance in the language. Macros allow
  Lisp code to manipulate other Lisp code, providing a powerful metaprogramming
  capability that sets Lisp apart from many other programming languages.
